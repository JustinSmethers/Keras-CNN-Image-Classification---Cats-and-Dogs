# Keras-CNN-Image-Classification---Cats-and-Dogs
Build a convolutional neural network that's able to predict whether an input image is a cat or a dog. The data comes from a kaggle competition

https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats

I split the data up into a training set and a test set. The training set consisted of two folders, one with 4000 images of dogs and the other with 4000 images of cats. The test set had two folders, one containing 1000 images of dogs and the other containing 1000 images of cats

# What you'll need
You'll need the keras and tensorflow packages
